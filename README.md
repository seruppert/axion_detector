### are_sims\_all\_ez

Reads the E field integrations from COMSOL using the relevant function in comsol_formfactor\_processing.
Plots the various components of the E field, both normed then integrated and integrated then normed. The relevant plots produced can be found in the 13/9/22 post on confluence showing that indeed the E field was predominantly in the Z direction for the fundamental. Data can be found in confluence under "integrations including...".
